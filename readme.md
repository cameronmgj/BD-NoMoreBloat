# NoMoreBloat Plugin for BD

Options to hide the following tabs from the start page of discord:
- nitro tab
- friends tab
- shop tab

This is my first attempt at a plugin for BD, and my first time using JavaScript.

If you encounter any bugs, or have requests/suggestions, please open an issue and mark it as [feature request]

No instructions necessary, just go into your plugins and check the boxes of what tabs you want to hide. I am aware of potential contraast issues with these checkboxes against some backgrounds, and may later upgrade the checkboxes to the toggles frequently used by other plugins if possible.
